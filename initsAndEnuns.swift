/* Initializers (inits) in SwiftUI are special functions that initialize 
views with specific attributes. They play a crucial role in setting up and 
customizing views. Here are some key points about inits in SwiftUI:
Purpose:
Initialize views with default or custom attributes
Set up the initial state of a view
Allow for the creation of reusable views with varying attributes
Customization:
Can be customized with custom variables (e.g., colors, sizes, shapes)
Enable the creation of views with different attributes (e.g., different background colors)
Can be extended to include additional setup or configuration
Example: */
struct CustomView: View {
    let backgroundColor: Color

    init(backgroundColor: Color = .blue) {
        self.backgroundColor = backgroundColor
    }

    var body: some View {
        Rectangle()
            .fill(backgroundColor)
    }
}

/* In this example, we define a CustomView struct that takes a backgroundColor
parameter in its init method. The backgroundColor parameter has a default value
of .blue, so you can create a CustomView without specifying a background color.
The CustomView struct creates a Rectangle view with a fill color based on the
backgroundColor parameter. This allows you to create CustomView instances with
different background colors by passing in a custom color value or using the default
value of .blue.
By using inits in SwiftUI, you can create flexible and customizable views that
adapt to different requirements and use cases. Inits are a powerful tool for
setting up views with specific attributes and customizing their appearance and
behavior.*/

//You can create an instance of CustomView with a default blue background color:

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        CustomView()
    }
}

/* In this example, we create an instance of CustomView without specifying a

about enums in SwiftUI:

Purpose:
