/*Scroll views are a fundamental component in SwiftUI, allowing users to scroll 
through content on the screen. They provide a flexible and customizable way to display 
content that exceeds the screen size. With SwiftUI, you can easily create scroll views 
that enable both horizontal and vertical scrolling, making it easy to display large 
amounts of content in a compact and user-friendly way.
Key Features of Scroll Views in SwiftUI:
Horizontal and Vertical Scrolling: Scroll views support both horizontal and vertical 
scrolling, allowing you to display content in a variety of formats.
Customizable: SwiftUI provides a range of customization options for scroll views, 
including the ability to change the scroll direction, add padding, and modify the 
appearance of the scroll indicators.
Dynamic Content: Scroll views can display dynamic content, such as lists and grids, 
making it easy to display large amounts of data in a scrollable format.
Accessibility: Scroll views in SwiftUI are accessible by default, making it easy 
to create apps that are usable by everyone.
Common Use Cases for Scroll Views:
Lists and Tables: Scroll views are ideal for displaying long lists and tables of data.
Image Galleries: Scroll views can be used to create image galleries that allow users 
to scroll through a collection of images.
Text Content: Scroll views can be used to display large amounts of text content, 
such as articles and documents. */

/*Customizing Scroll Views in SwiftUI
Scroll Views in SwiftUI can be customized to fit your app's design and functionality. Here are some ways to customize Scroll Views:

You can turn off the scroll indicator to create a cleaner interface. To do this, use the .scrollIndicators modifier and set it to .never:

By default, Scroll Views scroll vertically. You can change the scroll direction to horizontal by 
passing .horizontal as an argument to the ScrollView initializer:

/*3. Add padding
You can add padding around the content within the Scroll View using the .padding() modifier:
 */

 ScrollView {
    // content

.padding()

/*4. Customize the appearance

You can customize the appearance of the Scroll View content by adding background colors, corner radii,

strokes, and shadows using modifiers like .background(), .cornerRadius(), .overlay(), and .shadow():

Creating a Scrollable Image Gallery in SwiftUI

To create a scrollable image gallery in SwiftUI, you can use a ScrollView and a ForEach loop to 
display a collection of images. Here's an example of how to create a scrollable image gallery in SwiftUI:

 */

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(1...5, id: \.self) { index in
                    Image("image\(index)")
                        .resizable()
                        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
                        .cornerRadius(10)
                        .padding()
                }
            }
        }
    }

}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}

/*In this example:

The ScrollView has a .horizontal axis to enable horizontal scrolling.

The HStack contains a ForEach loop that generates 5 images.

Each image is loaded from an asset named "image\(index)".


The Image view is resizable and has an aspect ratio of .fit.

Each image has a size of 200x200, a corner radius of 10, and padding.

This creates a scrollable image gallery in SwiftUI, allowing you to swipe through a collection of images.

Tips:

Use ScrollView with a .horizontal axis to enable horizontal scrolling.

Use ForEach loops to generate dynamic content within the image gallery.

Customize the appearance and behavior of the images using modifiers and conditional statements.*/

/*Optimizing Large Data Sets with Lazy Stacks
When working with large data sets in SwiftUI, it's crucial to optimize your app's 
performance to avoid unnecessary data loading and improve efficiency. One way to achieve this is 
by using lazy stacks, such as LazyVStack and LazyHStack.
What are lazy stacks?
Lazy stacks are views that create their contents only when needed, rather than creating all content at once. 
This approach helps reduce memory usage and improve performance, especially when dealing with large data sets.
How do lazy stacks work?
When you use a lazy stack, SwiftUI only creates the views that are currently visible on the screen. 
As the user scrolls or navigates through the content, SwiftUI creates additional views as needed. 
This approach ensures that your app only loads the data that is necessary, reducing the overhead of 
loading and storing large amounts of data.
Benefits of using lazy stacks
Improved performance: Lazy stacks reduce the overhead of loading and storing large data sets, making 
your app more responsive and efficient.
Reduced memory usage: By only creating views when needed, lazy stacks help reduce memory usage, 
which is especially important for large data sets.
Better user experience: With lazy stacks, your app can handle large data sets without sacrificing performance, 
providing a better user experience.
When to use lazy stacks
Large data sets: Use lazy stacks when working with large data sets that would otherwise cause performance issues.
Dynamic content: Use lazy stacks when your content is dynamic and changes frequently.
Scrolling views: Use lazy stacks in scrolling views, such as lists or grids, to improve performance and efficiency.
By using lazy stacks, you can optimize your app's performance and efficiency, especially when working with large data sets. 
Remember to use LazyVStack and LazyHStack instead of VStack and HStack to take advantage of 
lazy loading and improve your app's overall performance. */

// Example of using LazyVStack with a large data set in SwiftUI:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVStack {
                ForEach(1...1000, id: \.self) { index in
                    Text("Row \(index)")
                        .padding()
                        .background(Color.blue)
                        .cornerRadius(10)
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}

/*In this example:

The ScrollView contains a LazyVStack instead of a regular VStack.

The ForEach loop generates 1000 rows of text content.

Each row is displayed with a blue background, rounded corners, and white text.

By using LazyVStack, you can optimize the performance of your app when working with large data sets.*/

// Example of using LazyHStack with a large data set in SwiftUI:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {

                ForEach(1...1000, id: \.self) { index in
                    Text("Column \(index)")
                        .padding()
                        .background(Color.blue)
                        .cornerRadius(10)

        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}


/*In this example:

/*In this example:

The ScrollView contains a LazyVStack instead of a regular VStack.

The LazyVStack creates views only when needed, improving performance with large data sets.

The ForEach loop generates 1000 rows of text content.

Each row is displayed with a blue background, rounded corners, and white text.

By using a LazyVStack, you can optimize the performance and efficiency of your app when working with large data sets.

Tips:


Use LazyVStack to display a large number of views in a scrollable container.

Use LazyVStack with large data sets to improve performance and efficiency.

Customize the appearance and behavior of the views within the LazyVStack using modifiers and conditional statements.*/
